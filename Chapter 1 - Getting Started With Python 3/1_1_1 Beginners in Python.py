# # Introduction to Python

# Python is open source, interpreted, high level language and provides great approach for object-oriented programming. It is one of the best language used by data scientist for various data science projects/application. Python provide great functionality to deal with mathematics, statistics and scientific function. It provides great libraries to deals with data science application.
# Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991. They sought for ways to make the software easy to read, simple and alowed users to contribute which is open source.
# One of the main reasons why Python is widely used in the scientific and research communities is because of its ease of use and simple syntax which makes it easy to adapt for people who do not have an engineering background. It is also more suited for quick prototyping.

# 
# # Computing for Everybody
# As python was becoming popular, Van Rossum submitted a funding proposal to DARPA called "Computer Programming for Everybody", in which he further defined his goals for Python:
# - An easy and intuitive language just as powerful as major competitors
# - Open source, so anyone can contribute to its development
# - Code that is as understandable as plain English
# - Suitability for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times
# 
# > In 2018, Python was the third most popular language on GitHub, a social coding website, behind JavaScript and Java.
# 
# According to a programming language popularity survey it is consistently among the top 10 most mentioned languages in job postings. Furthermore, Python has been among the 10 most popular programming languages every year since 2004 according to the TIOBE Programming Community Index.
# 
# # The Zen of Python
# 
# The Zen of Python is a collection of 19 "guiding principles" for writing computer programs that influence the design of the Python programming language. Software engineer Tim Peters wrote this set of principles and posted it on the Python mailing list in 1999. Peters's list left open a 20th principle "for Guido to fill in", referring to Guido van Rossum, the original author of the Python language. The vacancy for a 20th principle has not been filled.

# - Beautiful is better than ugly.
# - Explicit is better than implicit.
# - Simple is better than complex.
# - Complex is better than complicated.
# - Flat is better than nested.
# - Sparse is better than dense.
# - Readability counts.
# - Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
# - Although practicality beats purity.
# - Errors should never pass silently.
# - Unless explicitly silenced.
# - In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
# - There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.
# - Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
# - Now is better than never.
# - Although never is often better than right now.
# - If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
# - If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
# - Namespaces are one honking great idea—let's do more of those!

# # Jupyter Notebook

# ## What is Anaconda?
# 
# Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package management and deployment. 
# 
# There are several alternatives, however Anaconda is the most popular due to simplicity of managing the python components.
#

# ## Jupyter Notebook
# Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebooks) is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating Jupyter notebook documents. The "notebook" term can colloquially make reference to many different entities, mainly the Jupyter web application, Jupyter Python web server, or Jupyter document format.
# 
# The Jupyter Notebook App can be carried out on a local desktop requiring no internet access or can be installed on a remote server and accessed via the internet.
# 
# Now that you have installed your own Jupyter notebook, you can create your own notebook to run Python codes.
# Use anaconda to install packages in your Anaconda environment. You can run simple mathematical Algebra calculations in your notebook. 
# 
# ### Uses of Jupyter Notebook
# 
# - Jupyter Notebook allows users to convert the notebooks into other formats such as HTML, ASCIIDOC,LaTex, Reveal.js slides, and PDF. It also uses online tools and nbviewer which allows you to render a publicly available notebook in the browser directly.
# 
# - Jupyter Notebook is highly independent because it is represented as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, which is a language-independent, text-based file format. Another reason is that the notebook can be processed by any programing language, and can be converted to any file formats such as Markdown, HTML, PDF, and others.
# 
# - It is highly independent because it is depicted as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, which is an independent language, text file format. Another reason is that the notebook can be handled by any programing language, and can be converted to any file formats such as Markdown, HTML, PDF, and others.
# 
# - Jupyter notebook uses ipywidgets packages, which provide a number of common user interfaces to explore code and data interactivity.
# 
# Kernels: Kernels is a program that examines a user's code.
# IPython includes a kernel for Python code and there are kernels for several other languages.
# A notebook kernel is a “computational engine” that executes the code contained in a Notebook document. The ipython kernel, referenced in this guide, executes python code. Kernels for many other languages exist (official kernels).
# 
# When you open a Notebook document, the associated kernel is automatically launched. When the notebook is executed (either cell-by-cell or with menu Cell -> Run All), the kernel performs the computation and produces the results. Depending on the type of computations, the kernel may consume significant CPU and RAM. Note that the RAM is not released until the kernel is shut-down.
# 
# #### Creating your Notebook
# The jupyter notebook is friendly and codes are written with explanations which makes it easier to comprehend. You'll learn how to create your own notebook in a short time. Using your own jupyter note book brings your python code lessons to life.
# 
# ##### Creating your own notebook
# Click the start button and search Anaconda. Launch the annoconda software and choose Jupyter notebook from the anaconda enviroment, which will open a new tab in your default web browser that should look like the screenshot below. 
# ![Ananconda-versions-download-Windows.jpg](https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jupyter-dashboard.jpg)
# The Jupyter dashboard will give you access only to the files and sub-folders contained within Jupyter’s start-up directory (i.e., where Jupyter or Anaconda is installed). 
# 
# Jupyter Notebook open in your default browser, you may have noticed that the URL for the dashboard is something like https://localhost:8888/tree. Note that Localhost is not a website, but indicates that the content is being served from your local machine: your own computer.
# Jupyter’s Notebooks and dashboard are web apps, and Jupyter starts up a local Python server to serve these apps to your web browser, making it platform-independent and opening the door to easier sharing on the web.
# 
# The dashboard’s interface can be understood at first glance. Browse to the folder in which you would like to create your first notebook, click the “New” drop-down button in the top-right and select “Python 3”.
# Each time you create a new notebook, a new  .ipynb file will be created.
# ![Screenshot%20%286%29.png](attachment:Screenshot%20%286%29.png)
# 
# 
# #### Code
# The code cell allows users to execute lines of code within a Python kernel and produces results for lines of code executed.
# As you execute the Python code, its output is displayed under the code. The output can be in the form of text, picture, matplotlib diagrams or HTML tables.
# 
# #### Markdown
# Markdown helps the user explain codes that are executed within a Python Kernel. This makes the notebook easier to read and less cumbersome. This cell contains all types of formatting features, such as creating bold and italic text, headers, displaying ordered or unordered lists, bullet lists, hyperlinks, table content, images, etc.
# To perform the Marksdown formatting features, first select Markdown cell from the drop-down menu.
# 
# To make the text as a header, start the text using # symbol. The number of # symbols depends upon the size of the header.
# 

# ## Goggle Colab
# 
# Note on Google Colab
# Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, allows you to write and execute Python in your browser. Colab notebooks allow you to combine executable code and rich text in a single document, along with images, HTML, LaTeX and more. When you create your own Colab notebooks, they are stored in your Google Drive account. You can easily share your Colab notebooks with co-workers or friends, allowing them to comment on your notebooks or even edit them.
# 
# The benefits it offers are:
# 
# Zero configuration required
# Free access to GPUs
# Easy sharing
# The basic version with minimal GPU (used for Deep learning) is available for free. Those of you who are working on google colab will find no difference between most of the work you do on your local jupyter environment.

# # Boolean

# You would have come across ‘True’ or ‘False’ in Mathematics. We will learn booleans, and show examples of how booleans work in Python; in arithmetics operators. 
# 
# Booleans in Python
# In Python, the boolean is a data type that has only two values and these are;
# 1. True and
# 2. False.
# 
# #### Boolean as a Value in Python
# Like any other value such as a number, string, etc., 
# Boolean value by assigned to a variable. For example,

# In[29]:


a = True
print(type(a))


# In[30]:


b = False
print(type(b))


# #### Boolean as a Variable in Python
# In Order to check if the variable is True. You can see the folowing example.

# In[31]:


bool(a)


# In[32]:


bool(b)


# #### Boolean and Strings
# Booleans confirms a String as True, with exception of an empty string. Let's look at examples

# In[33]:


bool(" ")


# In[34]:


bool("")


# In[35]:


bool('Betsy')


# In[36]:


bool('Nigeria')


#  #### Lists, tuples, and dictionaries in Boolean
#  For list, tuples and dictionaries will be False if they do not have any element or they are empty. 
#  Lets look at examples;

# In[37]:


bool(())


# In[38]:


bool((2,4))


# In[39]:


bool([])


# In[40]:


bool(['d'])


# In[41]:


bool({})


# In[42]:


bool({5 :'Michael'})


# ### Operators in Boolean

# In[43]:


20 < 10


# In[44]:


10 > 5


# In[45]:


10 == 8


# ### Logic Operators
# Logical operators can either be True or False. Boolean operators in Python include and, or, and not.
# The ‘and’ gives True if both the operands are True else returns False. The ‘or’ gives True if at least one of the operands is True else returns False. The operator ‘not’ takes works on only one operand and gives True if the operand is either 0/ empty value/ False, or else it returns False.
# 
# Note: True is considered as 1 and False as 0.

# In[46]:


True and False


# In[47]:


False or True


# In[48]:


not False


# In[49]:


not True


# In[50]:


True + False


# In[51]:


True + True


# In[52]:


True - False


# ### False Values
# - Constans defined to be None or False are treated as False values
# - Zero of any numeric type: 0, 0.0, 0j 
# - Empty sequences or collection: [], "", {}, set()

# In[53]:


a = 0
if a:
    print ("Hello")
else:
    print ("Bye")


# ### Boolean Operation
# We would see examples of boolean in real life situation which can be applied in web development.

# In[54]:


a = 10
b = -3

if a > b:
    print('correct')
else:
    print('wrong')


# In[55]:


a = 3
b = 3
 
if a is b:
    print(True)
else:
    print(False)


# In[56]:


a = ["1", "2", "3", "4"]
b = ["1", "2", "3", "4"]
 
print(a is b)


# In[57]:


Jersey = ['Green', 'Red', 'White']

team_jersey = input("Enter the color of your team's jersey: ")
if team_jersey in Jersey and Tiger_points :
    print("This is the team's Personal best")


# In[58]:


Tiger_points = 85

# # Data Types in Python
# 
# - Numeric Types: int, float, complex
# - Sequences: list, tuple, range
# - Mappable: dict
# - Set: set, frozenset
# - Boolean
# - Binary: bytes, bytearray
# - Text: str

# In this chapter, we will talk about;
# - Numeric Types: int, float, complex
# - Binary: bytes, bytearray
# - Text: str
# 

# # Numeric Types
# 
# In Python 3, there is only one type “int” for all type of integers. In Python 2.7. there are two separate types “int” (which is 32 bit) and “long int” that is same as “int” of Python 3.x, i.e., can store arbitrarily large numbers. 
# In Python, value of an integer is not restricted by the number of bits and can expand to the limit of the available memory. In other languages, integer is either 2 or 4 bytes, thus restricted to a value of 2^X-1 (unsigned). 
# 
# Integers are whole numbers that include negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers such as -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3.
# Python uses the class int to represent all integer numbers. All integers are objects.
# Computers can’t store integers directly. Instead, they only can store binary numbers such as 0 and 1.
# To store integers, the computers need to use binary numbers to represent the integers.
# 
# For example, to store the number 5, the computers need to represent it using a base-2 number:
# 5 = 1 x 22 + 0 x 21 + 1 x 20
# 
# it takes 3 bits to store the number 5 in the memory:
# (101)2 = (5)10
# 
# 8 bits, can store up to 255 integers from zero to 255:
# 255= 1x 27 + 1 x 26 + 1 x 25 + 1x 24 + 1 x 23 + 1 x 22 + 1x 21 + 1 x 20
# 
# By using 8 bits, you can store up to 28 – 1 = 255 integers.
# To store both negative integers, zero, and positive integers, you need to reserve 1 bit for storing the sign, negative (-) and positive (+). Therefore, with 8 bits:
# 
# The largest integer that the computers can represent is 27 = 127.
# And the computers can store all integers in the range (-127, 127)
# Because the number zero doesn’t have a sign, the computers can squeeze out an extra number. Therefore, 8 bits can store all integers from -128 to 127.
# 
# 8-bits = [-27, 27 – 1]
# 
# Similarly, if you want to use 16 bits, 32 bits, and 64 bits to store integers, the ranges would be:
# 16-bits ~ [-215, 215 – 1] = [-32,768, 32,767]
# 32-bits ~ [-231, 231 – 1] = [-2,147,483,648, 2,147,483,647]
# 64-bits ~ [-263, 263 – 1] = [-9,223,372,036,854,775,808, 9,223,372,036,854,775,807]
# 
# Python, doesn’t use a fixed number of bit to store integers. Instead, Python uses a variable number of bits to store integers. For example, 8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits, 64 bits, 128 bits, and so on. The maximum integer number that Python can represent depends on the memory available. Also, integers are objects.

sys.getsizeof(a)


# ### Python Integer Operations
# Python integers support all standard mathematical operations including:
# 
# - Addition +
# - Subtraction –
# - Multiplication *
# - Division /
# - Exponents *
# We will look at examples:

# In[62]:


x = 15
y = 14
z = 10

Answer = x * y 

print(Answer)


# In[63]:


print(type(Answer))


# In[64]:


Answer = x + y
print(Answer)


# In[65]:


Answer = x - z
print(Answer)


# In[66]:


print(type(Answer))


# # Float
# Python float() function is used to return a floating-point number from a number or a string. 
#   Syntax:  float(x)
#   
# In Python string cannot be converted to float except for strings like: nan and infinity.

# In[67]:


Ans = 3+2j
Ans


# In[68]:


z.real


# In[69]:


z.imag


# In[70]:


print(float("nan"))


# In[71]:


print(float("infinity"))


# In[72]:


print(float(80))


# In[73]:


f = 3.9999
int(f)


# In[74]:


float(f) + 2


# # String
# Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string. We can also perform slices in a string by making the string callable or assigning it to a variable.

# In[75]:


head = 'living healthy is good living'
print(head)


# In[76]:


len(head)


# In[77]:


print(head[6:])
head


# In[78]:


print(head[10:])
head


# In[79]:


print(head[1:3])
head


# In[80]:


head.lower()


# In[81]:


heads = print(head.split()) #to split the letters and separate it with a comma.


# In[82]:


print(head.rsplit())


# In[83]:


age = 6
print("Musa is "+ str(age))
